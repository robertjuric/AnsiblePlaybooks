# AnsiblePlaybooks

This repo is a collection of Ansible Playbooks I've created for various automation tasks. Each playbooks is located in a separate directory with its own README file.  

## Getting Started

Each playbook has been created for my own environment. Therefore things such as host groups and group variables may have to be changed to suit your environment. I've tried to highlight the possible issues in the individual playbook README files.

### Prerequisites

Playbooks were originally written for use with Ansible 2.7.1. Additional requirements are listed in individual playbook README files.


## Playbook Index
